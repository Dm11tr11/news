  <h1>Greenhill Park Gets a Makeover</h1>

  <p>By Dmitrii</p>

  <p>Greenhill Park, a popular hangout for families and students, just reopened after a six-month renovation project. The park now features a brand-new skatepark, updated playground equipment, and a fitness trail.</p>

  <p>“We wanted to create a space where everyone feels welcome,” said local council member Jane Rivers. “These changes were designed based on community feedback.”</p>

  <p>The park will also host events this summer, including movie nights and live music on Saturdays.</p>
